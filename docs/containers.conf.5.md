% containers.conf(5) Container engine configuration file

# NAME
containers.conf - The container engine configuration file specifies default
configuration options and command-line flags for container engines.

# DESCRIPTION
Container engines like Podman & Buildah read containers.conf file, if it exists
and modify the defaults for running containers on the host. containers.conf uses
a TOML format that can be easily modified and versioned.

Container engines read the /usr/share/containers/containers.conf and
/etc/containers/containers.conf files if they exists.  When running in rootless
mode, they also read $HOME/.config/containers/containers.conf files.

Fields specified in containers conf override the default options, as well as
options in previously read containers.conf files.

Not all options are supported in all container engines.

Note container engines also use other configuration files for configuring the environment.

* `storage.conf` for configuration of container and images storage.
* `registries.conf` for definition of container registires to search while pulling.
container images.
* `policy.conf` for controlling which images can be pulled to the system.

# FORMAT
The [TOML format][toml] is used as the encoding of the configuration file.
Every option is nested under its table. No bare options are used. The format of
TOML can be simplified to:

    [table1]
    option = value

    [table2]
    option = value

    [table3]
    option = value

    [table3.subtable1]
    option = value

and `systemd`.

**conmon_env_vars**=[]
  Environment variables to pass into Conmon.

**conmon_path**=[]
  Paths to search for the conmon container manager binary. If the paths are
empty or no valid path was found, then the `$PATH` environment variable will be
used as the fallback.

    The default list is:
```
conmon_path=[
		"/usr/libexec/podman/conmon",

		"/usr/bin/conmon",
		"/usr/sbin/conmon",
		"/usr/local/bin/conmon",
		"/usr/local/sbin/conmon",
		"/run/current-system/sw/bin/conmon",
]
```

**detach_keys**="ctrl-p,ctrl-q"
  Keys sequence used for detaching a container.
  Specify the keys sequence used to detach a container.
Format is a single character `[a-Z]` or a comma separated sequence of
`ctrl-<value>`, where `<value>` is one of:
`a-z`, `@`, `^`, `[`, `\`, `]`, `^` or `_`

**enable_port_reservation**=true
  Determines whether the engine will reserve ports on the host when they are
forwarded to containers. When enabled, when ports are forwarded to containers,
they are held open by conmon as long as the container is running, ensuring that
they cannot be reused by other programs on the host. However, this can cause
significant memory usage if a container has many ports forwarded to it.
Disabling this can save memory.

**events_logger**="journald"
  Default method to use when logging events.
  Valid values: `file`, `journald`, and `none`.

**image_default_transport**="docker://"
  Default transport method for pulling and pushing images.

**infra_command**="/pause"
  Command to run the infra container.

**infra_image**="k8s.gcr.io/pause:3.2"
  Infra (pause) container image name for pod infra containers.  When running a
pod, we start a `pause` process in a container to hold open the namespaces
associated with the  pod.  This container does nothing other then sleep,
reserving the pods resources for the lifetime of the pod.

**lock_type**="shm"
  Specify the locking mechanism to use; valid values are "shm" and "file".
Change the default only if you are sure of what you are doing, in general
"file" is useful only on platforms where cgo is not available for using the
faster "shm" lock type.  You may need to run "podman system renumber" after you
change the lock type.

**namespace**=""
  Default engine namespace. If the engine is joined to a namespace, it will see
only containers and pods that were created in the same namespace, and will
create new containers and pods in that namespace.  The default namespace is "",
 which corresponds to no namespace. When no namespace is set, all containers
and pods are visible.

**no_pivot_root**=false
  Whether to use chroot instead of pivot_root in the runtime.

**num_locks**=2048
  Number of locks available for containers and pods. Each created container or
pod consumes one lock.  The default number available is 2048.  If this is
changed, a lock renumbering must be performed, using the
`podman system renumber` command.

**active_service**=""
  Name of destination for accessing the Podman service.

**[service_destinations]**

**[service_destinations.{name}]**
  **uri="ssh://user@production.example.com/run/user/1001/podman/podman.sock"**

    Example URIs:

- **rootless local**  - unix://run/user/1000/podman/podman.sock
- **rootless remote** - ssh://user@engineering.lab.company.com/run/user/1000/podman/podman.sock
- **rootfull local**  - unix://run/podman/podman.sock
- **rootfull remote** - ssh://root@10.10.1.136:22/run/podman/podman.sock

  **identity="~/.ssh/id_rsa**
    Path to file containing ssh identity key

**pull_policy**="always"|"missing"|"never"
Pull image before running or creating a container. The default is **missing**.

- **missing**: attempt to pull the latest image from the registries listed in registries.conf if a local image does not exist. Raise an error if the image is not in any listed registry and is not present locally.
- **always**: pull the image from the first registry it is found in as listed in registries.conf. Raise an error if not found in the registries, even if the image is present locally.
- **never**: do not pull the image from the registry, use only the local version. Raise an error if the image is not present locally.

**runtime**="crun"
  Default OCI specific runtime in runtimes that will be used by default. Must
refer to a member of the runtimes table.

**runtime_supports_json**=["crun", "runc", "kata"]
  The list of the OCI runtimes that support `--format=json`.

**runtime_supports_nocgroups**=["crun"]
  The list of OCI runtimes that support running containers without CGroups.

**runtime_supports_kvm**=["kata"]
  The list of OCI runtimes that support running containers with KVM separation.

**static_dir**="/var/lib/containers/storage/libpod"
  Directory for persistent libpod files (database, etc).
By default this will be configured relative to where containers/storage
stores containers.

**stop_timeout**=10
  Number of seconds to wait for container to exit before sending kill signal.

**tmp_dir**="/var/run/libpod"
  The path to a temporary directory to store per-boot container.
Must be a tmpfs (wiped after reboot).

**volume_path**="/var/lib/containers/storage/volumes"
  Directory where named volumes will be created in using the default volume
driver.
  By default this will be configured relative to where containers/storage store
containers. This convention is followed by the default volume driver, but may
not be by other drivers.

# FILES
Distributions often provide a `/usr/share/containers/containers.conf` file to
define default container configuration. Administrators can override fields in
this file by creating `/etc/containers/containers.conf` to specify their own
configuration. Rootless users can further override fields in the config by
creating a config file stored in the
`$HOME/.config/containers/containers.conf` file.

If the `CONTAINERS_CONF` path environment variable is set, just
this path will be used.  This is primarily used for testing.

Fields specified in the containers.conf file override the default options, as
well as options in previously read containers.conf files.
